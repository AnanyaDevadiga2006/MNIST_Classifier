# MNIST Digit Classifier

This project is a simple **multiclass classifier** that can recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.  

## How it works:
1. Loads MNIST dataset.
2. Builds a neural network with one hidden layer.
3. Trains the model for 5 epochs.
4. Tests the model on unseen data.
5. Saves the trained model as `mnist_model.h5`.

## Usage:
Run the script using:
